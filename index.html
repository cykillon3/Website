        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Talha, a self-taught VRChat Avatar creator and editor with a knack for bringing ideas to the virtual world.
          I like creating anime-style models with features such as emotes, different outfits, weapons, and much more. I join
          my 3D modeling skills with web application development to create simple and unique 3D web apps.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>VRChat furry avatar with a hint of FNaF series</h3>
        <h4>Goal:</h4>
        <p>The goal was to create an avatar from scratch without using any third-party assets.</p>
    
        <h4>Process:</h4>
        <p>
          I began with a <a href="/images/reference.png" target="_blank">reference</a> sheet and a brief description of the avatar's functions.
          Using Blender, I modeled the base body of the avatar and collaborated with the client to make any necessary adjustments. After finalizing the model, I textured it in Substance Painter and then rigged it in Blender. Once the model was complete, I set it up in Unity for use in VRChat. The model is cross-platform compatible (PC and Oculus Quest).
        </p>
    
        <h4>Challenges:</h4>
        <p>
          One challenge I faced was that the client wanted the model to be grabbable by other players, allowing them to lift the avatar in-game. I achieved this by using Phys Bones in Unity, adding a toggle for Phys Bones in all parts of the armature. This was rooted to the handle bone on the back of the model, putting the avatar in a T-pose and allowing other players to grab it by its back handle.
        </p>
    
        <h4>üèÜ Accomplishments:</h4>
        <p>
          The model turned out great, and I learned many new things throughout the process.
